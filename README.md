# Qed

Qed is a troubleshooting tool for distributed teams. It keeps complex investigations coherent.

The guiding framework behind Qed's design is called [differential
diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis). Qed allows users to apply this
medical methodology - in which practitioners write out symptoms, hypotheses, and actions to be taken
â€“ to troubleshooting problems in general.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
To run a development instance of it, use `npm start`. To run the tests, use `npm test`.

## Dev roadmap

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/danslimmon/qed/issues) to track work on this project. Each
issue is associated with one of the following milestones:
